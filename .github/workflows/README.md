# Workflows

This folder contains workflows run in GitHub. This readme created as a way to document the workflow(s) and re-usable workflows. **But...** on creation of this I've realized that it creates more maintenance that I could end up forgetting to do in the future.

So I think the approach will be to have comments in each workflow to describe it's purpose so that when that changes it can be updated at the same time, hopefully.

And this file will be a broad summary of what the thinking is for this folder without touching on specifics that will change.

## Naming conventions

### Re-usable workflows

Starts with `_` to place the file at the top.

Followed by `workflow` to highlight that it is a re-usable workflow.

Then `.jobs.` to highlight that the workflow contains jobs, technically not needed.

The the purpose of the workflow, with `_` in place of space.

### Actual workflows

Currently not real naming convention created for these, to be made when there are more than 1.
