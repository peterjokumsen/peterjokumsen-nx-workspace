# markdown-parser

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Purpose

This library is meant to act as a parser of Markdown text. It will take in a string of Markdown text and return an object that represents the parsed markdown.

> While there are many libraries that can parse Markdown, this library is meant to be something for me to play around with. If it proves itself useful, I might publish it as an NPM package.
>
> _Which could also be an interesting project to play with._ ðŸ¤”

## Building

Run `nx build markdown-parser` to build the library.
