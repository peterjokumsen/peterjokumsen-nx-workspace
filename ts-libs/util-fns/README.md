# Utility Functions (util-fns)

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Purpose

This library is meant to contain utility functions that can be used in any TypeScript application or library.

All functions should be pure functions, meaning they should not have any side effects and should not rely on any external state. And they should have a prefix of `pj` to avoid name collisions with any other libraries.

## Building

Run `nx build utils` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test utils` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Functions

- [`pjFilterMap`](src/lib/pj-filter-map/README.md)
