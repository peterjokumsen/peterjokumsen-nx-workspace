# Learning stuff

This is a collection of my journeys into learning new things. I will be documenting my learning process and sharing it with you. I hope you find it useful.

> Starting with [`journeys` is not spelt `journies`](https://www.grammar-monster.com/plurals/plural_of_journey.htm) as I originally thought 😁.

I would like to make this into multiple sub-pages, but the site currently does not have that kind of functionality. I still need to [figure out how I want to achieve that](https://github.com/peterjokumsen/peterjokumsen-nx-workspace/issues/24) 🏗️.
So for now, I will just keep everything to this page.

## Angular Material Theming

I absolutely love [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io), but I consistently run into issues with theming.

This isn't because [Angular Material theming](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) is particularly difficult,
but because **every time** I need to do it, I find myself repeating a `developer strat`, which goes something like this:

- Find documentation 🔍
- _Scan_ documentation 🫣😎
- Copy code block from the first thing that seems relevant to my circumstance 🤷
- Paste code block into my project 🤖
- Run project 🏃‍♂️‍➡️
- Start a 1-3 hour back and forth with the browser dev tools, trying to figure out why the code I copied isn't working 🚶‍♂️‍➡️
- Realize I have spent a lot of time incorrectly assuming the context of the code that I've copied, adjust my assumption(s) and try again ♻️
- Reach a point where project is looking alright 🤠
- Refactor changes 🧹
- Break everything 🤡
- Reconsider life choices 🫠
- Start again with more knowledge at hand 🧑‍🎓

This is the happy case of when I don't chase any squirrels to procrastinate, which is something I've kind of done already with all of the emojis I've used in the list above.

Although I have improved on this process with a few steps that I'll hopefully list out in a proper article. I have found that the areas where I have a good fundamental knowledge short circuits this process. And this could really be helped by actually reading the documentation the first time.

So let me get back to the reading, and I will hopefully update this little article with the basic notes of what I learnt 🤞
